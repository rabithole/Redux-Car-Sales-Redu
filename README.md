## Re-doing Redux Car Sales
### Diving deaper into understanding redux, the reducer pattern and actions. 

#### Lambda School redux project. 
- Originally done in 2019. I didn't completely understand how redux worked. 
- I definitely have a much better understanding now!

## _MVP Requirements:_

- Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
- Set up the Redux flow
- User should be able to add features to their car
- User should be able to remove added features from their car
- Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car
